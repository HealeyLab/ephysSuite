<h2>Setup</h2> 
For this setup, I use IntanTech's RHD2000 evaluation board with an RHD2000 amplifier, either 16- or 32-channel versions. Additionally, I use an Arduino UNO to send certain stimulus information to the board. Take a look at ephysSuiteSetup.fz for a more granular inspection of the setup.
